# Problem 1 - Positive, Negative, or Zero
Write a program that asks the user for a number.

Use an if-else if- else to determine if the number is positive, negative, or zero. A number is considered positive if it is greater than to 0. A number is negative if it is less than 0.

Once you determine a number is not positive and not negative, that leaves one case left – the number must equal zero!

If it is positive, print `“The number is positive!”`
If it is negative, print `“The number is negative!”`

If it is zero, print `“The number is neither positive nor negative!”`
