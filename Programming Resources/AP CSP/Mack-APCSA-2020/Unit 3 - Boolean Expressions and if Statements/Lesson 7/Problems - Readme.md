# Problem 1 - Comparing Circles
This program is incorrectly comparing Circles using `==`.

Modify the `CircleTester` class to correctly compare Circle objects using `.equals`

Youâ€™ll need to implement the following methods in the `Circle` class so that the `CircleTester` can correctly compare and print `Circle`s:
```
public String toString()
public boolean equals(Circle other)
```
equals should only return true if both Circles have the exact same attributes (color, radius, x, and y). toString should return a `String` of the form `[color] circle with a radius of [radius] at position ([x], [y])`.

For example:
```
Circle circle = new Circle(10, "blue", 50, 40);
System.out.println(circle);
```
Should print out
```
blue circle with a radius of 10 at position (50, 40)
```
