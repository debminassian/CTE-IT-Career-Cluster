# Problem 1 - Using the Rectangle Class
This program makes use of the `Rectangle` class from the previous example. It contains two files: `Rectangle.java` and `RectangleTester.java`.

You should add code to `RectangleTester.java` to create a rectangle with a width of 5 and height of 12 and then print out the object.

# Problem 2 - Student GPA Field
This program starts with the `Student` class from earlier. We want to add a new instance variable (or field) that represents the student’s GPA. Since it can contain a decimal place, you’ll need to figure out the right type.
