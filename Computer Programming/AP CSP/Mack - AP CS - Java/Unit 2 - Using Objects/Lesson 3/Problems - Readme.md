# Example: Null Pointer Exception
Because of the uninitialized object, this code will throw a NullPointerException.

See if you can figure out how to fix the exception.

# Problem 1 - Plain Coffee
This class represents a cup of coffee. Right now, the only way to make a cup of coffee is to specify exactly how the coffee should be made.

Add an overloaded constructor that does not take any parameters. This will allow us to make a “default” cup of coffee, which is how most people would expect a normal cup of coffee to be made.

In the overloaded constructor, set `brewStrength` to 3, `sugar` to true, and `milkType` to “whole”.

# Problem 2 - Custom Piñatas
This class represents a piñata. If you aren’t familiar with piñatas, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi%C3%B1ata), a piñata is a shape or animal made out of paper mache and is filled with candy or toys. People take turns trying to break open the piñata while wearing a blindfold!

The class only has a constructor without parameters. Your job is to add three more constructors so the user can design their own pinatas:

1. A constructor that allows users to customize all the instance variables.
2. A constructor that allows users to customize the color and the shape.
3. A constructor that allows users to customize the candy.
You can see the descriptions in the Pinata class. You can also see how the constructors should be able to be used in PinataTester.java.

**Note**: The additional constructors will take values as formal parameters. You do not need to prompt the user for these values.

After you make the constructors, you should be able to run your program **without changing code in PinataTester.java.**

In the constructors, use the default values given in the default constructors to fill in any values that were not passed as parameters.
