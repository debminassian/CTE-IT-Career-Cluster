# Problem 1 - Weight of a Pyramid
Write a program that estimates how much Kufu’s pyramid in Giza weighs.

Your program should assume that every block weighs 2.5 tons. Kufu’s pyramid in Giza used around 2,500,000 blocks.

You should use two variables, `numBlocks` and `blockWeight`, to calculate the weight.

Here is an example output for a pyramid that uses 150,000 blocks:
```
The pyramid weighs 375000.0 tons
```
**Note**: Your number should be different!

# Problem 2 - Add Fractions
In this program you will initialize 4 integers that represent each part of two fractions, namely the numerator and denominator of the first fraction and the numerator and denominator of the second fraction.

Your program should add the two fractions and print out the result.

For example, a sample program run might look like this
```
The numerator of the first fraction is 1
The denominator of the first fraction is 2
The numerator of the second fraction is 2
The denominator of the second fraction is 5
The sum of 1/2 + 2/5 = 9/10
```

**Note**: you do not need to reduce these fractions. Be sure to test your code for positive and negative integers by changing the values of your initialized variables.

Remember, if you have two fractions you add them with:
```
     a         c        ad + bc
    ___   +   ___    =   ______
     b         d           bd
```
