# Problem 1 - Explore Selection Sort

In this exercise, we will be looking at our example code for Selection Sort.

However, while we are sorting we will also count the number of swaps taking place, then print them out once the array has been sorted.

Add a print statement at the end of the selectionSort method that prints out the number of swaps that took place during the sort.

You should not modify the `main()` method.

**Hint**: Where are items compared? Try writing out the steps in the algorithm on paper to help.

# Problem 2 - Explore Insertion Sort

Instead of ordering Insertion Sort in ascending order, change the code to sort in descending order.

# Problem 3 - Selection Sort vs. Insertion Sort Run Time

Explore this example comparing the runtime between Selection Sort and Insertion Sort.

Using the Selection Sort vs Insertion Sort example activity, please answer the following free response questions in complete sentences:

- Change the size of both reverse and reverse2, and almostSorted and almostSorted2 to 10. What do you notice about the run time comparison between Insertion and Selection sort for both array types? Why do you think that is? Use execution counts to help justify your response.

- Now change the size of reverse, reverse2, almostSorted and almostSorted2 to 1000. What do you notice about the run time comparison between Insertion and Selection sort for both array types? Why do you think that is? Use execution counts to help justify your response.

- Which sorting method do you prefer/ makes most sense to you? How come?
