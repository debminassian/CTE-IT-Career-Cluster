# Problem 1 - Which Team?

For this exercise, you are given a `Team` superclass with a `BaseballTeam` and `FootballTeam` subclass. Take a moment to examine these classes and the instance variables and methods in each.

In the TeamTester class, you will see three objects declared and instantiated using the `Team`, `FootballTeam`, or `BaseballTeam` classes.

For each object, use a print statement to print out any public method that returns information that is available for that particular object, including the toString.

For example, the `dolphin` object is a `FootballTeam` object. One of the pieces of information that can be printed is the `getTies()` method, so you will call that method in your `TeamTester` file:

`System.out.println(dolphins.getTies());`

Do this for all the methods that each of the objects can call.

**Hint**: Remember, for the program to compile and run, Java looks for methods to exist in certain classes.
