# Problem 1 - Person / Student Object

In this exercise, you are going to use the Person and Student classes to create two objects, then print out all of the available information from each object.

Your tasks
- Create a Person object with the following information:
    - Name: Thomas Edison
    - Birthday: February 11, 1847
- Create a Student object with the following infromation:
    - Name: Albert Einstein
    - Birthday: March 14, 1879
    - Grade: 12
    - GPA: 5.0

You do not need to modify the Person or Student class.

# Problem 2 - Books

For this activity, you are going to refactor the `Book` superclass and the `Dictionary` and `Fiction` subclasses.

Right now, the `Book` class is empty and the `Dictionary` and `Fiction` classes have instance variables and getter and setter methods. Your task is to move common attributes and methods to the `Book` superclass and remove them from the subclasses.

**Note**: You do not need a constructor in any class.
