# Problem 1 - Work Shift
A doctor works 20 hours, 42 minutes, and 16 seconds in one shift at a hospital. Convert the total shift time into seconds and display that information.

**NOTE**: You must use at least ONE compound operator (`+=, -=, *=, /=, %=`) to complete this program.

# Problem 2 - My Age
Using only one variable called `age` and the increment and decrement operators, produce the output for your current and upcoming age next year, then back to your current age.

Sample output:
```
My current age is: 14
My age next year will be: 15
My current age is: 14
```
