# Problem 1 - Print Odd Array Indices5 points
Here we have a program that creates an integer array. Fill in the method `printOddIndices` to print out just the elements stored at the odd indices of the array.

For example, the following code:

`int[] arr = new int[] {10, 20, 30, 40};`
`printOddIndices(arr);`

Should print out:

`20`
`40`

Because the odd indices in `arr` are 1 and 3, and index 1 stores the value 20 and index 3 stores the value 40.

# Problem 2 - Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, â€¦

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

For example, the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1). The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2). The 5 is found by adding the two numbers before it (2+3), and so on! Each number in the sequence is called a term.

In this exercise, you will need to:

- Create the array `int[] sequence` that holds the values of the first 15 terms of the Fibonacci sequence. Think carefully about what happens to the index when iterating through the loop to fill this array. Read the Fibonacci description above to help!
- Then print out the sequence of numbers separated by a space.
- Finally, create a method `findIndex` to find the index of the term 55.

Sample output:

`Fibonacci sequence up to 15 terms:`
`0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 `
`Index position of 55 is: 10`

**Hint**: You will need to use several loops: One to fill the array, one to print the array, and one to traverse the array!
