# Problem 1 - Find the Median
Write a method called median that returns the median value in the array.

If the length of the array is odd, the median is the value in the center of the array.

If the length of the array is even, the median is the average of the two numbers in the center.

You may assume the array passed into this method will never be empty.

Sample output:

`The median value of the EVEN array is 19.5`
`The median value of the ODD array is 22.0`

**Hint**: Weâ€™ve imported `java.util.*` for you, so you have a handy static method on Arrays that you can use called `Arrays.sort` so you can sort your array BEFORE finding the median.

# Problem 2 - Car Showroom

In this exercise, you will need to write two methods.

A car showroom consists of N numbered spaces. Each space can hold at most one car. The spaces are indexed starting from 0 though the last space, N - 1. No two cars in the showroom are the same model.

- Write the `CarShowroom` method `findCarSpace`. This method returns the index of the space in which the car with the specified model is located. If there is no car of that model in the showroom, the method returns -1.

- Then write the `CarShowroom` method `consolidate`. This method should move the cars so that cars in adjacent spaces, starting at index 0, have no empty spaces between any two cars. Keep the order of the cars the same as the array in the code shows. The `toString` method has been provided to print out filled and unfilled spaces.

Output:

`Space 0 has a Mustang with a top speed of 157`
`Space 1 has a Camaro with a top speed of 155`
`Space 2 has a  null `
`Space 3 has a Corvette with a top speed of 194`
`Space 4 has a  null `
`Space 5 has a  null `
`Space 6 has a Porsche with a top speed of 210`
``
`Index of Mustang should be 0 and is 0`
`Index of Corvette should be 3 and is 3`
`Index of Miata should be -1 and is -1`
``
`Original Car Showroom:`
`Space 0 has a Mustang with a top speed of 157`
`Space 1 has a Camaro with a top speed of 155`
`Space 2 has a  null `
`Space 3 has a Corvette with a top speed of 194`
`Space 4 has a  null` 
`Space 5 has a  null` 
`Space 6 has a Porsche with a top speed of 210`

`Car Showroom after cars have been consolidated:`
`Space 0 has a Mustang with a top speed of 157`
`Space 1 has a Camaro with a top speed of 155`
`Space 2 has a Corvette with a top speed of 194`
`Space 3 has a Porsche with a top speed of 210`
`Space 4 has a  null `
`Space 5 has a  null `
`Space 6 has a  null`
