# Problem 1 - Upright Number Triangle
In this program, you need to make an upright triangle that contains the numbers 1-5. Your output should look like:
```
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5 
```
Modify the `makeNumberTriangle` method in the starter code to create this!

# Problem 2 - Make a Tree
In this program, you need to make an upright tree that contains stars *. Your output should look like:
```
         * 
        * * 
       * * * 
      * * * * 
     * * * * * 
    * * * * * * 
   * * * * * * * 
  * * * * * * * * 
 * * * * * * * * * 
 ```
Modify the `makeATree` method in the starter code to create this!

**Hint**: You will need to create a variable that controls how far the * is from edge of the console. That variable should change size each iteration through the outer loop!
