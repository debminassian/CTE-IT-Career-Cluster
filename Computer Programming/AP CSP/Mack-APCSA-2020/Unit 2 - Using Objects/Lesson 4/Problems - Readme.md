# Example: Area of a Rectangle
This is an example for this lesson. You are encouraged to play around with it, run and change the code, and learn how it works. When you are done, click continue to go to the next problem.

# Example: Program Flow
This program has print statements to mark the order of execution of the program.

Look at the output and find where the statement was printed in the code. That will show you how execution jumps from `main` to `Executable` and back as methods are called.

# Problem 1 - Hello!
As a twist on the Hello World exercise, you are going to be the end user of the Hello class. This class is designed to greet the user in a variety of world languages.

For this task, complete the following

- Use the `Scanner` class to ask the user for their name
- Create a `Hello` object by passing the name to the constructor
- Call at least 3 methods from the `Hello` class to print the greeting in 3 different languages.

Remember to write your code in the `HelloTester` class, but make sure you take a look at the Hello class so that you know the names of the methods you need to use.

# Problem 2 - Chat Bot

In this exercise, you are going to make a sample bot conversation. At this point, we don't have too much that we can do, but you are going to ask the user for their name and then use that in the constructor for the bot.



After that, you are going to simulate a conversation. You will print questions to the console and answer them by calling methods from the Bot class. (You don't actually prompt the user for any information other then their name).



When you are finished, your output should match the output below (with the exception of your name).



Sample Output:
```
Hello. What is your name?

Kiara

Hello Kiara! My name is Hal!

How are you today!

You can ask me about the weather,

or how many feet are in a mile.

I can even convert feet to meters!

What's the weather like?

Its always warm and dry inside your computer!

How many feet in a mile?

There are 5280 feet in a mile.

It was nice talking with you!

Have a great day!
```
**Challenge**: The bot does have some additional commands included, but we haven't covered these topics yet. Can you figure out how to access some of these methods?
