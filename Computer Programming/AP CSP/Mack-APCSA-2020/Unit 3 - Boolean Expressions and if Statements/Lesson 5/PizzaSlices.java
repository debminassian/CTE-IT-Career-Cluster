/*
 * Short Circuit Evaluation
 * ===================================
 * When evaluating conditional statements, Java will take
 * a shortcut, or short circuit, if it knows early on that
 * the entire statement will end up being true or false.
 * 
 * For example, in the statement
 * boolean shortCircuit = true || (a == b);
 * the a == b will never actually be evaluated, because true || anything
 * will always be true!
 *
 * See examples of this below:
