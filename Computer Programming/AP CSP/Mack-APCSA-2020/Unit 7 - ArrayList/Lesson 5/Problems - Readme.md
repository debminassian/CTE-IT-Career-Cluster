# Problem 1 - Linear Search on ArrayList with While Loop

In this exercise, you will code a modified version of sequential search from the previous example.

Here you should implement a method to do sequential search on an ArrayList of doubles and return the index of the search double, or -1 if it isn’t found using a while loop.

# Problem 2 - Fantasy Football Roster

Create a program that allows you to create a fantasy football roster based on the existing list of available players.

Your team can only have 5 players, so create an array that can store 5 possible players.

Prompt the user to pick 5 players to add to their team. If the player is available in the list of `availablePlayers`, then add that player to the user’s array, and remove that player from the `availablePlayers` list. Then prompt the user to pick another player. Once all five players have been added, print the list in the console.

Create a `search` method to find the index at which the player is located in the `availablePlayers` list so you can remove the player, and make sure that they are an eligible pick.
