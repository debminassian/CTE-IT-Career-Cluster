# Problem 1 - Initializing an ArrayList
An ad agency is interested in keeping track of their clients a little more easily.

Help them out by creating two ArrayLists:

- Create an ArrayList called `companyName` that stores an ArrayList of all the company names.
- Create an `Integer` ArrayList called `contractValue` that stores the value of the contract that the ad agency has with its clients.

# Problem 2 - Car Inventory
A car company wants to keep a list of all the cars that they have in stock. The company has created a `Car` class that stores important information about each of their cars.

Initialize an ArrayList called `inventory` that stores each Car that the company has in stock.
